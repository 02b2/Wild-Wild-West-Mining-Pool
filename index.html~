A WALLET HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because this enables you to gather your earnings in a trusted place that ONLY YOU have access to. Mining to an exchange address is 100% doable as well. I won't teach how to because I personally would never recommend that to anyone EVER. If you do insist on going that route that's on you & you can find the information online. Trusting a 3rd party is something you just simply don't have to do in crypto, therefore why subject yourself to such a risk?/p>

Two incredibly smart tech savvy cats and all credit is due to them. Although we use the same software, by supporting smaller mining pools we further strengthen the decentralization of the community.

        <p> Thank you all for your time checking out our site. We look forward to the contribution of our node(s) in order to help decentralize the network! </p>
    <ul>There are a few things that you should know, although they are explained in detail if you click the above links, I think having them in clear sight is the most honest way of showcasing them.
        <ul> The fees for this pool are 4% Total, 2% goes to the Developers and 2% goes to us for running this service. </ul>
            <ul> This can be subject to change but it will be very much so known and we will give everyone at least a 2 week notice before any changes occur. <b>IF</b> we were to change them it would strictly be a for a charity event in which whatever amount we raised the fees was donated to charity. There will be absoluitely no other changes that would take even ever.</b></ul>
        <ul> Payouts occur automatically due to the incredible development work that the Dero Community Pools has provided.</ul>
        <ul> Every 4800 blockls <b><u>AS LONG AS A SINGLE MINI-BLOCK</u></b> has been found then you will be paid out according to how much hash power you've contributed and how long you contributed for.</ul> 
             <ul> This means that whether you find a Mini Block yourself or not, so long as you've contributed at all then you will get paid!</ul>
