  <body>
    <h1>Getting started with android is maybe the easiest of all.</h1>
    <h2>It's also the most beneficial because being a device with a low hashrate you'll benefit the most from teaming up and sharing rewards like a this and other pools offer.</h2>
        <p>So to get started I've made it very easy for you and its a process taking 3 steps.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><u>You must download Termux.</u></li>
                <u1>Termux is no longer supported in the normal google play app store to my knowledge so what I'd recomend doing is going online to whomever you trust the most and download an apk directly from them. Your phone might have a security feature  that wont allow you to install apps downloaded from the internet. You need to disable this feature. </ul>
            <li><u>Next you will have to open a freshly installed termux and run the following 1 line of code.
                <u1><b>!! THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT ADVICE AND ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU OTHERWISE YOU NEED TO RUN RUN RUN!<br></u1>
                <u2>RUNNING A SCRIPT THAT YOU DONT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS DOING IS THE EQUIVALENT OF LETTING SOMEONE WITH POTENTIALLY BAD INTENTIONS HAVE FREE REIGN TO YOUR DEVICE!</u></b></u2>
        </ol>
